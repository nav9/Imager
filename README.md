# Imager
A project for enhancing images using evoutionary algorithms, ordinary image processing functions and eventually, more artificial intelligence algorithms, based on user requirement.  
  
## Existing functionality
* **Evolutionary image enhancer:** Uses Particle Swarm Optimization to show the user multiple variations of enhanced images and allows the user to choose the best among those, leading to more evolution stages where the image gets refined more based on the user's choice.  
* **Image resizing:** Resize and download multiple images at once.  
* **Image cropping:** Crop and download multiple images at once.  
  
# TODO
* Consider adding merge-images (https://www.npmjs.com/package/merge-images)
* Consider adding looks-same (https://www.npmjs.com/package/looks-same?ref=img.ly)
* Switch to glfx and add more parameters per particle (https://evanw.github.io/glfx.js/demo/)
* Consider lena.js (https://github.com/davidsonfellipe/lena.js/)
* Consider marvinj (https://www.marvinj.org/en/examples.html)
